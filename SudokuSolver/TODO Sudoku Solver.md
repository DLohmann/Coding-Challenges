# Sudoku Solver
## TODO:
- Finish coding the solver in c++.
- Use Emscripten (or `webassembly`) to compile the C++ solver to javascript/webassembly, and then host the Sudoku solver on your website.
- Try writing a `Python extension` to call the c++ sudoku solver.
- Modify the solver to detect if multiple solutions are possible.
- Set up `GoogleTest` to unit test the solver with several examples from LeetCode.
- Use python `Google ORtools` library to describe a sudoku game as an integer optimization problem and solve with the Google OR tools library. Compare the performance of this way to the c++ solver python extension from earlier.
