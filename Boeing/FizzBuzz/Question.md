# Boeing Interview

Boeing asked me a FizzBuzz. I coded it in Python before realizing that the question asked for a C program. Oops. The interviewers seemd satisifed anyway, but I wrote it in C after the interview.

*Run Python*
```bash
python3 FizzBuzz.py
```

*Run C*
```bash
gcc FizzBuzz.c -o FizzBuzz
./FizzBuzz
```
